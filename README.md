# TETRJS

## Tetris with Physics

![tetrjs](/gifs/tetrjs.gif)

I thought it would be a cool idea to make a tetris clone with physics, but in the course of development I came across someone who had a similar idea: https://stabyourself.net/nottetris2/ so I figured I'd just completely unapologetically rip off Not Tetris 2. Don't sue me.

I took the sprites from https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_gbc/tetris/sheet/26141/ (thanks AILE ZX)
